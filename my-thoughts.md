# My Thoughts on Digital Scarcity and Digital Assets

I think most digital assets should remain free for personal use and less stricter copyrights should be applied to digital assets for personal use.

There is no actual need to create digital scarcity as it will just try to limit the potential of the digital asset to be used by the general public.

Most artists don't make art for the sake of selling it they make it because they love to do it.

The web3 and the modern internet should be like the open streets where artists perform for the public and the public can use it and if they like their work they can donate to the artist.

If the artist would get more number of eye balls his value will increase automatically and companies would also approach him to use his brand value which is an intangible asset. He can then use these opportunities to earn some money.

> More eyeballs means more opportunities to earn money.

> Let Art be free for personal use.
